# Personal Website

This is the source for my personal website, hosted at
[nandeeka.github.io](https://nandeeka.github.io/).  It is a static site,
generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  To build it yourself, please
follow the instructions
[here](https://github.com/raxod502/example-website/blob/master/README.md#project-setup).
