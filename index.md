## About Me

Hi! I am a rising fifth-year Computer Science PhD student at University of
California, Berkeley, advised by [Chris Fletcher](http://cwfletcher.github.io/). I
work on understanding efficient implementations of domain-specific kernels with
a focus on building abstractions that unify a wide variety of kernels and
accelerator designs into a small set of primitives, in collaboration with [Joel
Emer](http://people.csail.mit.edu/emer/) and [Michael
Pellauer](https://dblp.org/pid/22/3969.html). I have applied this analysis to a
range of domains, including [sparse tensor
algebra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07931), transformers, and fully homomorphic
encryption.

I transferred to UC Berkeley in January 2023 following my advisor, before
which, I was a student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  There, I
worked on [hardware
security](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/ISCA52012.2021.00035) and began my
research on domain-specific kernels.

Before coming to the University of Illinois, I completed my B.S. in Computer
Science from Harvey Mudd College in 2020. There, I worked with [Chris
Clark](https://www.lair.hmc.edu/chris-clark) in the [Lab for Autonomous and
Intelligent Robotics](https://www.lair.hmc.edu/). Additionally, for my senior
capstone project, I added a [numerical programming
library](https://factor.netlify.app/book/about/tensors/README.md) to the
programming language [Factor](https://factorcode.org/).

In my free time, I enjoy cooking, [social
dancing](https://www.wcia.com/ciliving-tv/get-dancing-with-illini-swing-society/),
traveling with my family, and studying Korean.

Please feel free to reach out to me by email at nandeeka [at] berkeley [dot]
