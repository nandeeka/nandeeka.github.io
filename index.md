## About Me

Hi! I am a rising fourth-year, Computer Science PhD student at University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, advised by [Chris
Fletcher](http://cwfletcher.net/). I work on understanding domain-specific
accelerators for tensor algebra, with a focus on building abstractions that
unify a wide variety of kernels and accelerator designs into a small set of
primitives, in collaboration with [Joel
Emer](http://people.csail.mit.edu/emer/) and [Michael
Pellauer](https://dblp.org/pid/22/3969.html). In the past, I have also worked
on hardware security.

Before coming to the University of Illinois, I completed my B.S. in Computer
Science from Harvey Mudd College in 2020. There, I worked with [Chris
Clark](https://www.lair.hmc.edu/chris-clark) in the [Lab for Autonomous and
Intelligent Robotics](https://www.lair.hmc.edu/). Additionally, for my senior
capstone project, I added a [numerical programming
library](https://factor.netlify.app/book/about/tensors/README.md) to the
programming language [Factor](https://factorcode.org/).

In my free time, I enjoy cooking, [social
dancing](https://www.wcia.com/ciliving-tv/get-dancing-with-illini-swing-society/),
traveling with my family, and studying Korean.

Please feel free to reach out to me by email at ndnayak2 [at] illinois [dot]
